# Python, C - if/else, loops, functions

## Description of the files inside this folder:


0. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete a source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
- The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be: 
	- The number, followed by
		- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
		- if the number is 0: is zero
		- if the number is less than 0: is negative
	- followed by a new line

1. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete a source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number. The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program.
- The output of the program should be:
	- The string Last digit of, followed by
	- the number, followed by
	- the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
		- if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
		- if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
		- if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
	- followed by a new line

2. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Use one print function and one loop in the code.
3. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. Use one print function and one loop in the code.
4. Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal. Use one print function and one loop in the code.
5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. 
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. The last number should be followed by a new line. Only use no more than 2 print functions. Only use one loop in your code.
6. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1. Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. The last number should be followed by a new line. Only use no more than 3 print functions. Only use no more than 2 loops in your code. 
7. Write a function that checks for lowercase character. Returns True if c is lowercase. Returns False otherwise.
8. Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. 
9. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13. Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
